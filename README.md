# Meeting Room Monitor

Meeting rooms are sometimes booked in advance but not used and not released. This problem gets more expensive and time consuming the larger a company gets. Our project aims to solve this inconvenience once and for all.

# Tools

The tools we used to build our website and back-end are all Amazon
WS tools. For our scripts, we used Python 3.6, our Lambda functions are
written in Node.js 8.10 and most of our website scripts are in JavaScript. All
the tools we used will be described in detail at Section II Subsection 3 and
also the hardware specications along with the architecture we tested our
prototype on are described at Section III Subsection 1.
