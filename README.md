# Meeting Room Monitor

Meeting rooms are sometimes booked in advance but not used and not released. This problem gets more expensive and time consuming the larger a company gets. Our project aims to solve this inconvenience once and for all.

# Tools

The tools we used to build our website and back-end are all Amazon WS tools:
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon API Gateway
- DynmamoDB
- Cognito
- S3
- Route 53
- Certificate Managaer
- CloudFront

For our scripts, we used Python 3.6, our Lambda functions are
written in Node.js 8.10 and most of our website scripts are in JavaScript. 

# Project's Purpose
